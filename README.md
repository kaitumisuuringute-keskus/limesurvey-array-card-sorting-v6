# Array Card Sorting for LimeSurvey 6.x

**A custom question theme for "card sorting" in LimeSurvey 6.x based on arrays**

![Image Card Sorting](/img/array-card-sort.png)

This question theme is a modified version of [LimeSurvey-Card-Sorting-5x-6x](https://github.com/tpartner/LimeSurvey-Card-Sorting-5x-6x/). The question theme uses arrays instead of multiple short texts under the hood, which improves ease of localization, data standardisation and DB usage. 


## Installation:

- **Theme Manager** - Download the latest [release](https://github.com/kaitumisuuringute-keskus/limesurvey-array-card-sorting-v6/releases/). Under your LS installations themes settings go to question themes and then upload & install the release zip file.
- **Manual installation** - Extract the download and upload the *ArrayCardSort* folder to */pathToLimeSurvey/upload/themes/question/*.
