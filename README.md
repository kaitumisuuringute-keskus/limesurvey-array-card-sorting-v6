# Array Card Sorting for LimeSurvey 6.x

**A custom question theme for "card sorting" in LimeSurvey 6.x based on arrays**

![Image Card Sorting](/img/array-card-sort.png)

This question theme is a modified version of [LimeSurvey-Card-Sorting-5x-6x](https://github.com/tpartner/LimeSurvey-Card-Sorting-5x-6x/). The original used multiple short texts under the hood instead of arrays, which can cause issues with localization and increases data use unnecessarily. This optimized port aims to allow the use of arrays to allow better data management and localization.


## Installation:

- **Theme Manager** - Download the latest [release](https://github.com/kaitumisuuringute-keskus/limesurvey-array-card-sorting-v6/releases/). Under your LS installations themes settings go to question themes and then upload & install the release zip file.
- **Manual installation** - Extract the download and upload the *ArrayCardSort* folder to */pathToLimeSurvey/upload/themes/question/*.

## Use

- Under Arrays create "Array Card Sort" question
- Create subquestions for items to be dragged
- Create answer options for drag targets
